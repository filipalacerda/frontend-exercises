        <h2>What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          There are six: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>How do you explain ‘hoisting’ in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          Variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, allowing
          access before their actual definition.
        </p>

        <h2>What’s the difference between ‘===’ and ‘==’</h2>
        <p>
          === checks for strict equality (value and type), while == performs
          type coercion before comparison.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>What is the difference between call() and apply() methods ?</h2>
        <p>
          Both methods are used in a different situation:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>call()</b>
              It calls the method, taking the owner object as argument. The keyword this
              refers to the ‘owner’ of the function or the object it belongs to. We
              can call a method that can be used on different objects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>apply()</b>
              The apply() method is used to write methods, which can be used
              on different objects. It is different from the function call() because
              it takes arguments as an array.
            </li>
          </ul> 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>What does var myArray = [[]]; statement declares?</h2>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, this statement is used to declare a two-dimensional array.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>How many ways an HTML element can be accessed in JavaScript code? </h2>
        <p>
          There are four possible ways to access HTML elements in JavaScript which are:
          <ul>
            <li><code>getElementById()</code></li>
            <li><code>getElementByClass()</code></li>
            <li><code>getElementByTagName()</code></li>
            <li><code>querySelector()</code></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>What is the difference between innerHTML & innerText? </h2>
        <p>
          The innerText property sets or returns the text content as plain text of the specified node, 
          and all its descendants whereas the innerHTML property sets or returns the plain text or HTML contents in the elements.
          Unlike innerText, inner HTML lets you work with HTML rich text and doesn’t automatically encode and decode text.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>What is an event bubbling in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
         Consider a situation an element is present inside another element and both of them handle an event. 
         When an event occurs in bubbling, the innermost element handles the event first, then the outer, and so on.
